## Usage

FlatCV is designed to be user-friendly. Hereâ€™s a quick example of how to use it:

```c
#include "flatcv.h"

int main() {
    Image img = load_image("input.jpg");
    Image gray = convert_to_grayscale(img);
    save_image(gray, "output.jpg");
    free_image(img);
    free_image(gray);
    return 0;
}
```

## Examples

Here are some examples to demonstrate the capabilities of FlatCV:

### Grayscale Conversion

Convert an image to grayscale with just a few lines of code.

```c
Image img = load_image("colorful.jpg");
Image gray = convert_to_grayscale(img);
save_image(gray, "gray.jpg");
```

### Image Filtering

Apply a Gaussian blur to smooth out the image.

```c
Image img = load_image("noisy.jpg");
Image filtered = apply_gaussian_blur(img, 5);
save_image(filtered, "filtered.jpg");
```

### Image Manipulation

Resize an image to specific dimensions.

```c
Image img = load_image("large.jpg");
Image resized = resize_image(img, 800, 600);
save_image(resized, "resized.jpg");
```
